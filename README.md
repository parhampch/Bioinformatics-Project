# Bioinformatics-Project

In this project, I used bioinformatics methods and algorithms to analyze the GSE48558 dataset to find effective genes in Acute
myeloid leukaemia by using the limma and GEOquery libraries. For the research part of this project, I searched for treatments
and signs of this disease.
